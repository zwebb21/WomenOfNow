1 - the page is long and busy. It is really lovely but save some of this content and design for other pages. The goal of this page is to get ladies to clearly see where to sign up, and then to sign up. The more we add, we find that people can't figure out what we want them to do and leave the page.   [not done ] 




✅ ✅ ✅ 2 - In all locations, capitalize the G in McGowan[ ✅ ] 



✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ 3 - The large photo of the women should be a part of the main Hero part of the page at the top or we should nix it. (i need to ask for more specifics. where at the main. )



✅ ✅ ✅ 4- The "Evolving" line -- say "God Has Given You' and remove the scrolls in the background  basically chang the evolving line to "god has given you {✅ }


✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ 5 - Remove the clouds and "Special Message"  



6 - The letter from Donna is good but make the title for that all on one line and take up much less space. 



✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ 7 - Put the sign up box right at the top of the page where the button says "Sign Up" 



✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ 8 - Make the links at the bottom like privacy policy and such white. Also some of this should be handled by the overall website style guide and not specific to the landing page. The page needs to get put into the website admin area so we can see how it fits in the overall template. 



✅ ✅ ✅ ✅  9 - Purple boxes - God's, Eve's -- capitalization and apostrophes.  Consider 4 rows of 2 boxes on each row so they all fit better. 


✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ 10 - Have the sign up box at the bottom of the page also.
